<p>Within sarcomeres, the most basic unit of muscles, thin and thick filaments slide against one another to contract the muscle. Actin and tropomyosin compose the main structure of the thin filament while two homologous proteins, leiomodin and tropomodulin, compete for binding sites at the pointed end of the filament. Leiomodin forms a leaky cap that allows</p>
