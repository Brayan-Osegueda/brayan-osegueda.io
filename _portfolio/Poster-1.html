Within sarcomeres, the most basic unit of muscles, thin and thick filaments slide against one another to contract the muscle. Actin and tropomyosin compose the main structure of the thin filament while two homologous proteins, leiomodin and tropomodulin, compete for binding sites at the pointed end of the filament. Leiomodin forms a leaky cap that allows for the elongation of thin filament proteins while tropomodulin prevents the lengthening of the filament. This modulation of the filament is vital to the function of the muscle as any significant deviation from uniformity within cardiac muscles can result in cardiomyopathy. Within our research, our objective is to understand binding behaviors between leiomodin and tropomyosin in order to better form a model of thin filament length regulation. Specifically, we hypothesized that the regulation of thin filament length is based primarily on the differences in affinities of the two homologous proteins for tropomyosin. To test this, we engineered and introduced point mutations into a peptide fragment of the cardiac leiomodin isoform representing its tropomyosin binding site (Lmod2s1) and analyzed structural changes in complex with tropomyosin through circular dichroism and molecular dynamics simulations. We found that Lmod2s1 peptide fragments with point mutations such as Lmod2s1 E34Q, E36V, S24K, and the double mutant S24KE36V provided a gradient of affinities that, in conjunction with prior studies and future studies into length of filaments versus affinity of leiomodin, will allow us to test if our hypothesis is indeed true.
