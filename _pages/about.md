I am first and foremost a student in all aspects of my life. Constantly learning and honing my skills, I found that I graduated college with a desire to do more. As an incoming graduate student at Washington State University, I am excited and hopeful for my career in academia. 

I am studying Bioengineering with a focus in protein engineering. My aim is to bridge the gap in computational protein-protein interaction prediction and real world results seen at the bench. 

My ultimate goal is to continue my work in academia to teach the new generations the implications and significance of protein engineering. 

Research Focus
======
My research investigates the molecular mechanisms underlying protein-protein interactions, with a specialized focus on structural dynamics and binding affinities in muscle regulatory systems. I utilize molecular dynamics simulations to predict conformational changes induced by point mutations, circular dichroism spectroscopy to quantify secondary structure alterations, and actin co-sedimentation assays to measure binding thermodynamics. My primary systems of study include troponin complexes and their calcium-dependent activation pathways, as well as leiomodin-tropomyosin interactions within sarcomeric filaments.

Academic Path
======
I am beginning my graduate studies in Engineering Science with a Bioengineering concentration at Washington State University. This step builds upon my undergraduate research in protein biophysics. My long-term goal is to establish an independent research program that synergizes computational structural biology with biochemical validation to create predictive models of protein function.

Publications and Presentations
------
I co-authored a publication in the Journal of General Physiology that demonstrated calcium's direct role in thick filament activation (Mohran et al., 2024). In addition, I am second-author in a manuscript examining mutation effects in leiomodin-tropomyosin binding interfaces. My work has been presented at six national conferences, including the Biophysical Society Annual Meeting (2025) and ABRCMS (2023).

Technical Expertise
------
My computational skills include molecular dynamics using Amber22, structural modeling with UCSF Chimera, and scientific computing in Python and MATLAB. On the experimental side, I am proficient in protein engineering through site-directed mutagenesis, structural characterization via circular dichroism, and quantitative binding assays using actin co-sedimentation techniques.

Mentorship and Service
------
I have guided twelve undergraduate researchers in molecular biology techniques and developed curriculum for a precalculus tutoring program. As a peer mentor for the NIH-funded MARC program, I supported fellow students in their research career development
